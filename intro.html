        In today's digital age, our personal information is constantly
        being shared, collected, and analyzed by companies and governments
        around the world. This includes data such as our name, age, location, 
        browsing history, or social media activity among all the possibilities.
        With so much of our lives taking place online, the potential for our 
        privacy to be compromised has never been greater. <br> <br> Cybercriminals
        can hack into databases and steal personal information, while companies can 
        use our data for targeted advertising or other purposes without our consent. 
        Governments can also use our data for surveillance. Data breaches can have serious
        consequences for our online privacy, including the risk of identity theft and fraud.
        When cybercriminals gain access to personal information such as our name, address, 
        social security number or credit card details. They can use this data to commit
        identity theft and financial fraud. <br><br> A common form of online identity theft
        is phishing scams, where a criminal sends an email or message that appears to be from 
        a legitimate source, asking for sensitive information. If the victim falls for the scam
        and gives the information, the criminal is easily able to steal their identity. Another form 
        of online identity theft is hacking, where cybercriminals use techniques to gain access to 
        databases and steal personal information to sell it on the dark web for other criminals 
        to use for their illegal activities.
